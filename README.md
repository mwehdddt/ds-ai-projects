# Data Science and AI Projects
This repository showcases various data science and artificial intelligence projects utilizing Kaggle datasets. This collection of Jupyter notebooks aims to explore different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning in order to deepen my understanding of AI and data science by applying theoretical concepts to practical projects.

## 001 League of Legends wins predection 
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min

This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k League of Legends ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level. 

Goal : Predict which team will win the game 


## 002 MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification
Dataset: https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each represented as a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

Goal: Build a classification model to correctly identify digits (0-9) from the images.

## 003 Student Admissions
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

This dataset contains information about students' academic records and other factors influencing admissions into graduate programs.

Goal: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of admission based on the students' profiles, and identify the key features that significantly impact admission outcomes.

## 004 Diamonds Prices Prediction
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds

This dataset contains information on the prices and attributes of diamonds, including features such as carat weight, cut, color, and clarity.

Goal: Develop a model to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics

## 005 CS:GO Round Winner Classification 

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification

This dataset includes information about rounds played in CS:GO, with attributes that can be used to classify the winning team based on various in-game events and player statistics.

Goal : Build a model that can predict the round winner based on the statistics of each round 

## 006 Spam detection 

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

This dataset contains 5,572 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam messages based on the message content.

Goal : Fine-tune an LLM model (DistilBERT) for a binary classification task (spam detection)
